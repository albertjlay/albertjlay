## Projects I'm super proud of
### [MathSoc Cartoons Page](https://mathsoc.uwaterloo.ca/cartoons/) on MathSoc's website - 2021
I collaborated with the coordinator of *MathSoc Cartoons* to design and implement their page on MathSoc's website, which currently houses 20+ 
of their incredible work 🎉! This project was a huge milestone for me as it was the first of my work that was published for the whole word to see!
I also learned a lot about color schemes, proper layouting, and a bit of UI design through this experience.

### [Stats Made Easy](https://github.com/albertjlay/statsmadeeasy) - 2020
This was the first project I made from scratch! Looking back at the code now, it's a bit of a mess 😅. However, the feeling of actually building something
without guidance was truly unforgettable!
